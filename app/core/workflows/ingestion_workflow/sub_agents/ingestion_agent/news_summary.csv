1,"Heavy pre-monsoon downpour caused major flooding across Koramangala, BTM Layout, and HSR Layout in mid-May 2025, delivering over 100 mm within 12 hours (May 18–19). Roads and underpasses were submerged, thousands of commuters stranded, and at least three fatalities occurred (one from a wall collapse in Whitefield and two by electrocution in BTM Layout)."
2,"Severe sewage-tainted waterlogging struck homes and streets in Koramangala, BTM Layout, and HSR Layout during the same pre-monsoon events, with wastewater entering residences and disrupting traffic. The health hazard was notable, as contaminated sumps and blocked drains became widespread."
3,"A thunderstorm in July brought down poles and damaged transformers around Koramangala and Adugodi, triggering a large-scale power failure. BESCOM logged over 7,800 outage complaints and received 33,000 distress calls during the incident."
4,"On July 17, emergency maintenance led to planned power shutdowns across Koramangala, Jayanagar, Peenya, and RR Nagar from 10 AM to 5 PM, as BESCOM upgraded substation equipment, causing widespread inconvenience."
5,"Metro and flyover construction work near the Silk Board junction ramped traffic onto poorly surfaced service roads, causing continuous congestion between ORR, Koramangala, and BTM Layout. Drivers faced bumpy roads and slowdowns due to craters and narrow lanes—classified medium in severity."
6,"Ongoing delays in the Ejipura flyover project created perilous conditions, with wrong-side riding, road debris, and frequent traffic snarls reported daily at the Koramangala–Ejipura junction. The incomplete infrastructure heightened safety concerns."
7,"Light rain triggered fuel-burning snail-paced jams in the Bellandur–Sarjapur–ORR corridor, spilling into feeder lanes used by commuters traveling to Koramangala and BTM. Anecdotal reports described vehicles burning ~3 L petrol for just 1.5 km of crawl."
8,"A fatality arose when a compound wall collapsed in Whitefield during pre-monsoon rains, killing a 32-year-old woman. The incident occurred amid citywide flooding and paralysis, affecting underpasses and main traffic arteries including BTM Layout and Koramangala."
9,"A falling tree in Katriguppe (just west of BTM Layout) fatally injured an auto-driver amid high winds and rains, and blocked roads leading into city IT corridors. Clean-up and traffic diversions followed, highlighting the risk to peripheral roadways."
10,"A BTM Layout underpass near the Silk Board junction became flooded after sewage lines backed up post-rain, resulting in ankle-deep standing water and causing a medium-severity traffic jam that extended to Koramangala feeder routes."
